# Musify
A mobile app for creating compatibilities based on music taste

This app uses a Spotify API to fetch information regarding songs that an user searches for.
After an user has introduced 5 songs, he can search for a compatibility.
The compatibilities are calculated based on a score(5*common songs+3*common artists+1*common genres). The best compatibility is shown each time
The application also uses real time chat between users, via Firestore Firebase
